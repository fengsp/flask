    Variable arguments that are unknown to the target endpoint are appended
    to the generated URL as query arguments.  If the value of a query argument
    is `None`, the whole pair is skipped.  In case blueprints are active
    you can shortcut references to the same blueprint by prefixing the
    local endpoint with a dot (``.``).

    This will reference the index function local to the current blueprint::

    For more information, head over to the :ref:`Quickstart <url-building>`.

    To integrate applications, :class:`Flask` has a hook to intercept URL build
    errors through :attr:`Flask.build_error_handler`.  The `url_for` function
    results in a :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError` when the current app does
    not have a URL for the given endpoint and values.  When it does, the
    :data:`~flask.current_app` calls its :attr:`~Flask.build_error_handler` if
    it is not `None`, which can return a string to use as the result of
    `url_for` (instead of `url_for`'s default to raise the
    :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError` exception) or re-raise the exception.
    An example::

        def external_url_handler(error, endpoint, **values):
            "Looks up an external URL when `url_for` cannot build a URL."
            # This is an example of hooking the build_error_handler.
            # Here, lookup_url is some utility function you've built
            # which looks up the endpoint in some external URL registry.
            url = lookup_url(endpoint, **values)
            if url is None:
                # External lookup did not have a URL.
                # Re-raise the BuildError, in context of original traceback.

                if exc_value is error:

            # url_for will use this result, instead of raising BuildError.
            return url

        app.build_error_handler = external_url_handler

    Here, `error` is the instance of :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError`, and
    `endpoint` and `**values` are the arguments passed into `url_for`.  Note

        By default, this function returns ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` from
        the configuration of :data:`~flask.current_app`.

        Static file functions such as :func:`send_from_directory` use this
        function, and :func:`send_file` calls this function on
        :data:`~flask.current_app` when the given cache_timeout is `None`. If a
        cache_timeout is given in :func:`send_file`, that timeout is used;
        otherwise, this method is called.

        This allows subclasses to change the behavior when sending files based
        on the filename.  For example, to set the cache timeout for .js files
        to 60 seconds::

            class MyFlask(flask.Flask):
                def get_send_file_max_age(self, name):
                    if name.lower().endswith('.js'):
                        return 60
                    return flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age(self, name)

        .. versionadded:: 0.9
        """
        return current_app.config['SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT']

    def send_static_file(self, filename):
        """Function used internally to send static files from the static
        folder to the browser.

        .. versionadded:: 0.5
        """
        if not self.has_static_folder:
            raise RuntimeError('No static folder for this object')
        # Ensure get_send_file_max_age is called in all cases.
        # Here, we ensure get_send_file_max_age is called for Blueprints.
        cache_timeout = self.get_send_file_max_age(filename)
        return send_from_directory(self.static_folder, filename,
                                   cache_timeout=cache_timeout)
